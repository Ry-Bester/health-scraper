          <h1>ADHD</h1></div><p>Unfortunately the prevalence of ADHD in children and adults is 1 in 20&nbsp;and on the rise. ADHD can affect school performance, relationships, self&nbsp;esteem, and family dynamics. It can have a long lasting and damaging affect on the health of the entire family due to stress it inflicts on parents&nbsp;and children. The use of stimulant drugs such as Ritalin, Concerta, and&nbsp;Adderall can cause insomnia, mood swings, loss of appetite, heart&nbsp;problems and suicidal thoughts.</p>
          <p>Many patients and their families are now in search of natural therapies to&nbsp;treat ADHD rather than being on stimulant medications which have&nbsp;addictive properties. Dr. Lalezar’s holistic and Functional approach in supporting patients with ADHD includes evaluation of nutrients, neurotransmitters, heavy&nbsp;metals, amino acids, fatty acids, gut flora, and intestinal permeability.</p>
          <p>Often there is Vitamin D, Vitamin B6, Zinc, and Magnesium&nbsp;deficiency in patients with ADHD. We also have seen elevated Lead and&nbsp;Mercury in the body. &nbsp;These are considered neurotoxins and can adversely affect&nbsp;brain function and alter neurotransmitter levels. IV chelation is used to&nbsp;remove heavy metals and proper amino acids are prescribed to replace&nbsp;the deficiencies.</p>
          <p>IgG and IgA Allergy Testing is utilized to determine food and&nbsp;environmental sensitivities. The most common food allergens are gluten,&nbsp;dairy, eggs, soy, preservatives, food coloring, chocolate, and foods&nbsp;containing salicylates such as berries, chilipowder, apples and cider,&nbsp;grapes, oranges, peaches, plums, prunes, and tomatoes.</p>
          <p>Fatty acid replacement such as high quality fish oil is used to support patients with ADHD. &nbsp;Gut permeability is treated by use of broad spectrum Probiotics,&nbsp;nutrients, and IV vitamin drips. This gut healing and improved&nbsp;absorption of nutrients can be helpful in reduction of ADHD symptoms.</p>
