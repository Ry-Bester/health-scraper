        <p>Bacterial vaginosis is a vaginal infection which can cause malodorous discharge, itching, and burning. The most common cause of bacterial overgrowth is altered vaginal PH and bacterial flora. Conventional treatment includes metro-gel and boric acid vaginal suppositories. Although the above treatment resolves symptoms, many women continue to get recurrent infections. At the Health and Vitality Center, we have noticed a correlation with high levels of heavy metals and recurrent bacterial vaginosis. High heavy metals are correlated with lowered immunity. IV chelation therapy has been very helpful in resolving bacterial vaginosis once and for all. Specific Lactobacillus probiotic is prescribed to reinocculate the vaginal flora. These friendly bacterias produce hydrogen peroxide which prevent and inhibit the growth of bad bacterias. High dose IV vitamin C is also very powerful in boosting immunity and resolving recurrent infections.</p>
