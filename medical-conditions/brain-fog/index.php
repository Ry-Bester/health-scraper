      <h1>Brain Fog and Treatments</h1>
      ><h2>Tired of having trouble focusing? Are you suffering from Brain Fog?</h2>
      <p>Having brain fog and a subjective sensation of mental clouding has become a new epidemic in our era. Most people young and old complain about having difficulty with focus and concentration level.</p>
      <p>Brain fog may be caused by all of the environmental toxins, dental amalgam fillings, pesticides, high mercury fish consumption, hormones in foods, and genetically modified foods such as corn, soy, and wheat.</p>
      <h2>How to get rid of Brain Fog</h2>
      <p>Removing heavy metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, cadmium, etc. through <a href="/treatments/iv-chelation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV chelation</a> is the fastest and safest way to treat brain fog. Many of our patients have experienced relief even after the first provocation IV chelation used for the 6-hour urine toxicity screen.</p>
      <h2>Brain Fog treatment:</h2>
      <p>DMPS IV chelation is followed by <a href="/treatments/glutathione-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glutathione IV</a>, an efficient combination of IV protocol for treating brain fog, which enhances the detoxification pathways and prevents redistribution of <a href="/medical-conditions/heavy-metal-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heavy metals</a> which cause brain fog.</p>
      <p>Balancing estrogen/progesterone ratio, testosterone, DHEA, cortisol, and thyroid can also be very effective in resolving brain fog.</p>
      <p>Effective vitamins for treating brain fog include high doses of <a href="/treatments/vitamin-c-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV vitamin C</a>, which build up different neurotransmitters in the brain and improve memory and concentration levels. A variety of amino acids are also supplemented to improve brain function.</p>
