    <h1>Asthma</h1><h2>Learn More About Asthma Treatment</h2>

      
      <p>Asthma is a constrictive and inflammatory airway disease, which causes coughing, wheezing, and breathing difficulty. It affects about 3% of the US&nbsp;population, and children under the age of 10 are most at risk.</p>
      <p>The key to a holistic treatment of asthma is to reduce allergic exposure to pollens, dust, molds, animal dander, wheat, dairy, and eggs. Skin and blood allergy testing can indicate allergic triggers. Most conventional allergy specialists in Los Angeles check for IgE mediated allergies but naturopathic doctors will also check for IgG and IgA mediated sensitivities.</p>
      <p>Once the allergy triggers are identified, a plan should be developed to reduce exposure.&nbsp; For instance, carpets should be removed and special beddings used to reduce dust mite exposure. Air filters such as HEPA and ionizing air purifiers work well, but ionization units should have low ozone output, which can also be an irritant.</p>


      <h2>Frequent Asthma Causes</h2>
      <p>Food sensitivities can cause asthma in 75% of children and 40% of adults. Dairy, eggs, wheat, gluten, citrus, peanuts, and chocolate are some of the most common allergens and asthma causes, although any food can be a potential irritant. Unfortunately, hidden allergies and food sensitivities are ignored by the conventional medical community, and most people are unaware of this type of allergy.</p>
      <h2>Natural Holistic Asthma Treatments</h2>
      <p>Almost always an elimination diet is the most powerful tool in determining and treating food sensitivities. Intravenous Magnesium or <a href="/treatments/myers-cocktail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Myersâ€™ cocktail</u></a> is a great tool in reducing muscle spasm in the airway of the lungs. Glutathione nebulizer is also prescribed to heal the lining of the bronchioles and open up the airway. Omega 3 fish oils in high doses are used to reduce inflammation in the lungs. High dose <a href="/treatments/vitamin-c-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IV vitamin C</u></a>, B6, B12, Selenium and molybdenum are also very important in the treatment of asthma.</p>
