      <h1>Osteoporosis</h1><h2>Learn More About Osteoporosis</h2>
      <p>Osteoporosis is a disease of the skeletal system in which bone tissue and bone mass are deteriorating. When bones become porous, they weaken and are more prone to breaks and fractures. While it can develop at any age, osteoporosis is most common in women over the age of 50. Risk factors include a family history of the disease, being postmenopausal, a low calcium intake, sedentary lifestyle and smoking.</p>
      <p>Vitamin D deficiency is also linked to osteoporosis, as this substance it essential for the formation and maintenance of bone tissue. The most common form of taking in Vitamin D is through both diet and exposure to the sun. People who spend more time indoors and who do not take supplements are at greater risk of Vitamin D deficiency, which can also lead to cardiovascular disease, skeletal deformities, cognitive impairments and asthma.</p>
      <h2>How is a deficiency diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>Conventional methods simply take a blood sample and measure the serum concentration of a particular vitamin or mineral. Static serum levels cannot accurately assess cell metabolism and utilization. At the&nbsp;<a href="/">Health &amp; Vitality Center</a>, the practice founded by our holistic doctor in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<a href="/about-us/">Dr. Shiva Lalezar</a>, we use SpectraCell micronutrient testing because it measures how micronutrients are actually functioning within your cells.</p>
      <h2>Holistic Treatment Options</h2>
      <p>First and foremost, the gut function will be optimized to improve absorption of nutrients.</p>
      <p>Then heavy metals such as mercury, lead, aluminum, and cadmium will be chelated out of your cells. If these metals remain in your system, they cause calcium to leak out of your bones.</p>
      <p>All hormones such as estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, and DHEA are optimized. These hormones prevent bone loss and rebuild bone structure. As a result, your bone density will increase on your dexa bone scan.</p>
      <p>Aside from IV vitamin therapy, Dr Lalezar has a powerful nutritional supplement protocol that also aids in restoring your bones. This protocol not only stops osteoporosis but it reverses it.</p>
