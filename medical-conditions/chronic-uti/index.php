    <h1>Chronic UTI</h1><h2>Learn More About Chronic UTI</h2>
    <p>Normally due to a shorter urethra women are more at risk of developing UTIs or bladder infections. Also as a woman reaches menopause, lack of estrogen causes the receptors in the urethra to become more susceptible to bacterial infections. Often times vaginal estrogen creams have been very helpful in alleviating recurrent UTIs. D-mannose is also prescribed to prevent UTI reoccurrence. D-mannose is a sugar molecule which binds to receptors in the urethra and blocks binding of bacteria on the receptors.</p>
    <p>High dose IV vitamin C has been very effective in boosting immunity and preventing infections.</p>
