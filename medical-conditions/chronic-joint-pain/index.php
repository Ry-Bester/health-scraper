      <h1>Heal Chronic Joint Pain</h1>arn More About Chronic Joint Pain</h2>
      <p>The most common cause of inflammation and joint pain is food allergies,&nbsp;environmental toxins, and hormone imbalance. To begin to heal chronic joint pain holistically it’s always essential to start an allergy elimination diet. Foods such as wheat, dairy, soy, corn, and eggs are the most common culprits. Nightshade vegetables such as eggplants, white potatoes, tomatoes, and bell peppers are also eliminated. Joint stiffness, inflammation, and pain go down when allergens are eliminated. Additionally, gut flora is evaluated and proper probiotics are prescribed. If there is leaky gut syndrome a protocol of IV nutrients and oral supplements are recommended to heal the lining of the gut and prevent leakage of antigens and antibodies into the bloodstream, which in effect damage the joints and cause chronic joint pain. IV MSM, IV Myers’ Cocktail, and Glutathione IV are excellent alternative therapies in treatment and healing of chronic joint pain holistically, as well as treating arthritis. Oral Glucosamine chondroitin, MSM powder, and fish oil are also part of the recommended protocol to relieve joint pain.</p>
