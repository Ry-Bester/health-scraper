      <h2>Learn More About Insomnia</h2>
      <p>Poor sleep quality is now effecting 30 percent of the population. Some have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, waking up early, or have non-restorative sleep. Stress, anxiety, and depression can cause insomnia and alternatively insomnia can cause emotional distress and physical ailment. It’s essential to find the root cause of insomnia and treat it with nutrients. Many sleep aids are addictive and do not address the cause of the issue.</p>
