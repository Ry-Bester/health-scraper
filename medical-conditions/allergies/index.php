      <h1>Allergies</h1></div><h2>Learn More About Allergies</h2></div><p>Allergy symptoms occur when your body’s immune system overreacts to normally harmless substances in the environment such as cat dander, dust, or pollen. Mast cells and basophils start releasing histamine and cause an inflammatory response which is manifested as red eyes, itchiness, runny nose, eczema, hives, or asthma.</p>
      <p>Skin and blood tests are utilized to check for IgE mediated allergies. A Functional Medicine practitioner will also test for IgG and IgA mediated allergies that are more subtle. &nbsp;Although antihistamines and steroids can give immediate symptomatic relief they would not enhance immune function and can indeed weaken the immune system. A Functional Medicine doctor will strengthen the immune system by healing leaky gut syndrome, removing heavy metals, and use IV vitamins such as the Myers’ Cocktail, Glutathione, and the Vitality drip. &nbsp;Myers’ Cocktail has magnesium which will relieve constricted airways in the lungs. &nbsp;High dose vitamin C in the Vitality drip will reduce histamine release and make histamine break down faster once it is released. &nbsp;(Vitamin C deficiency can increase blood levels of histamine). N-Acetyl Cysteine is also utilized to stabilize mast cells.</p>
      <p>Bioflavonoid-rich foods such as cherries, dark grapes, broccoli, red and green peppers, and drinking herbal teas can also be very helpful.</p>
