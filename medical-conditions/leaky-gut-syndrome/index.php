      <h1>Leaky Gut Syndrome</h1>
      <h2>Are you suffering from food allergies, joint pain, autoimmune diseases, low energy or skin conditions? It may be leaky gut.</h2>
      <p>Leaky Gut Syndrome, known medically as increased Intestinal Permeability, is a condition affecting the intestines that can cause various adverse reactions throughout the body. People with leaky gut may feel abdominal pain and bloating. They may develop Crohn’s, Ulcerative Colitis, IBS, chronic fatigue syndrome, inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, and allergies, among other conditions. At the&nbsp;<a href="/">Health and Vitality Center</a>, a leading center for Functional Medicine in Los Angeles,&nbsp;<a href="/about-us/">Dr. Shiva Lalezar</a>&nbsp;is an expert in treating Leaky Gut Syndrome.</p>
      <p>Your intestines are lined with cells that form a barrier to ensure that only properly digested proteins, fats and starches permeate the barrier and pass into your bloodstream. Normally, the spaces between these cells are tightly sealed to prevent toxins and bad bacteria from entering the blood. When these bonds loosen, however, undigested food particles and larger molecules escape into the bloodstream and travel through the body. This triggers the immune system to attack these cells and cause responses such as inflammation and irritation throughout the body.</p>
      <p>One of the main causes of leaky gut syndrome is heavy metal toxicity. Chronic stress, a poor diet filled with processed foods and refined sugars, infections and parasites, and some medications have been cited as triggers for leaky gut.</p>
      <h2>How is it diagnosed?</h2>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar uses a&nbsp;<a href="/treatments/leaky-gut-and-food-allergy-testing/">blood test</a>&nbsp;offered by Cyrex Laboratory which screens for multiple antibodies that indicate you have elevated Intestinal Permeability.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <h2>How is it treated?</h2>
      <p>If you are diagnosed with leaky gut, Dr. Lalezar will place&nbsp;you on a treatment protocol to heal the gut lining. This protocol may entail IV infusion therapy, allergy elimination diet, chelation therapy, candida cleanses, and targeted nutritional supplements.</p>
