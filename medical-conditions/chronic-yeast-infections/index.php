      <h2>Learn More About Chronic Yeast Infections</h2>
      <p>Chronic yeast infections have become an epidemic in our era. If you are not getting vaginal yeast infection it doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you are not having yeast overgrowth in your system. Systemic yeast can cause extreme fatigue, brain fog, joint pain, muscle ache, constipation, skin rash, dermatitis, gas, bloating, and memory loss.</p>
      <p>A CDSA (complete diagnostic stool analysis) can indicate if you have yeast overgrowth. Herbal and medicinal anti-fungals are prescribed to stop yeast growth.</p>
      <p>A strict candida free diet should be followed for at least 6 weeks eliminating sugar, fruits, gluten containing grains, dairy except yogurt, balsamic vinegar, honey, alcohol, potato, corn, coffee, citric acid, soy, and peanuts.</p>
