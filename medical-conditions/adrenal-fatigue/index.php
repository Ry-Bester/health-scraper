        <h1>Adrenal Fatigue</h1></div><h2>Are you affected by adrenal fatigue? Find out how you can support your adrenal glands.</h2></div><p>Prolonged emotional stress, poor sleep quality, blood sugar fluctuations, and inflammation can cause adrenal fatigue.</p>
        <h2>Adrenal fatigue is manifested in three stages.</h2>
        <h3>Stage 1 of adrenal fatigue is very gradual and insidious.</h3>
        <p>It’s caused by a prolonged stimulus to the adrenal glands, an increase in cortisol output, and a decrease in DHEA level. In this stage, estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone levels are also altered, which in turn affect the immune system and the <strong>metabolic rate</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Stage 2 of adrenal fatigue, your cortisol level continues to decline throughout the day but goes up in the evening.</h3>
        <p>DHEA level declines as well. In this phase of adrenal fatigue, the patient may develop <a href="/medical-conditions/anxiety-and-depression/">depression</a>, sweet cravings, decreased sex drive, insomnia, poor memory, anxiety, premenstrual syndrome, weakened immune response, recurrent infections, unexplained nervousness or irritability, inability to lose or gain weight, and <a href="/medical-conditions/chronic-joint-pain/">joint or muscle pain</a>.</p>
        <h3>Stage 3 of adrenal fatigue occurs when adrenals fail to meet the demands and are no longer able to produce cortisol.</h3>
        <p>In this crash phase, evening cortisol level is also very low. Several other hormonal imbalances occur in this stage as well. In this phase <a href="/medical-conditions/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/">chronic fatigue</a> occurs and the individual is unable to perform routine daily activities or work-related duties.</p>

            <p><strong>This diagram illustrates the common pattern of the hormone cortisol through the stages of adrenal exhaustion. The total cortisol sum as measured in nano molars (nM) is shown to rise then fall as the stages of exhaustion progress from&nbsp;</strong><strong>left to right.</strong></p>
            <h2>Adrenal Function Evaluation</h2>
            <p>Cortisol level is evaluated through collections of 4 saliva samples: upon awakening, lunchtime, mid-afternoon, and before bedtime. Neurotransmitters such as Serotonin, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, Dopa, GABA, Glutamine are evaluated through a<a href="/treatments/urine-toxicology-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> urine test</a>.</p>
            <h2>Treatment for adrenal fatigue</h2>
            <p>At Health and Vitality Center one of the ways we support the adrenal glands is through IV vitamin therapy.</p>
            <p>For stage 1 of adrenal fatigue, Dr. Lalezar would recommend the Myers’ Cocktail, a <a href="/treatments/iv-vitamin-drip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitamin IV therapy</a> of Magnesium and B Vitamins to calm the adrenals, reduce production of cortisol and alleviate stress.</p>
            <p>For stage 2 and 3 of adrenal fatigue, we use&nbsp;<a href="/treatments/iv-vitamin-drip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitality drip</a> which consists of 15-30 grams of vitamin C, minerals, B vitamins, Zinc, Chromium, Magnesium, and Calcium.</p>
            <p>Additionally, we may recommend IV Glutathione which consists of three amino acids and is a very powerful antioxidant to support the adrenal glands. &nbsp;Different oral supplements may also be recommended for different stages of Adrenal Insufficiency.</p>
            <p>As a last resort, Dr. Lalezar may prescribe physiologic doses of Hydrocortisone to help heal the adrenal glands. Please refer to Dr. William Jeffries’s book “Safe Uses of Cortisol.”</p>
