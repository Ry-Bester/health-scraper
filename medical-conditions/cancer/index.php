        <h2>Learn More About Cancer</h2>
        <p>Cancer occurs when cells start to multiply and grow abnormally. Despite signals sent from the body to stop production, cancer cells reproduce rapidly and turn into a tumor or a lump. When cancer spreads to other parts of the body, metastasis has occurred.</p>
        <h2>How to prevent cancer?</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Keep your body Alkaline and avoid foods that cause acidity</li>
        <li>Avoid environmental toxins such as heavy metals and gasoline</li>
        <li>Avoid Electromagnetic Field such as iPhones, wifi, and electrical heating pads</li>
        <li>Avoid Cigarette smoking and drugs</li>
        <li>Avoid Stress</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>What else is new?</strong></p>
        <p>At the University of Kansas City Cancer Center, Dr. Jeanne Drisko has teamed up with&nbsp;oncologist to study the effects of high dose vitamin C on cancer cells. &nbsp;In this study a patient with pancreatic cancer used high dose IV vitamin C therapy as the main mode of treatment and was able to survive for 4 years. &nbsp;(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5882293/). &nbsp;More studies are warranted in this field to see the effectiveness of high dose vitamin C as a pro-oxidant rather than an anti-oxidant. &nbsp;Perhaps vitamin C can also be given at high doses in conjunction to chemotherapy to support and improve the quality of life in those with end stage cancer.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lalezar uses the same protocol used at the Kansas City Cancer Center. &nbsp;This is not an FDA approved therapy and we do not claim or state that it can be used for treatment or cure of cancer. &nbsp;However with the approval of your oncologist we can use high dose IV vitamin C in conjunction to other treatments to support your body and help you with side effects of chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>Before starting high dose Vitamin C therapy, G6 PD level is checked. &nbsp;G6PD is an enzyme necessary to process Vitamin C. &nbsp;If&nbsp;it’s abnormal one won’t be able to receive high dose vitamin C because hemolytic&nbsp;anemia may occur.</p>
        <p>Vitamin C will be started at low doses and gradually increase in dose. &nbsp;Each infusion&nbsp;may take up to 2-3 hours and it’s given 2-3 times per week.</p>
