      <h1>Cardiovascular Disease</h1><h2>Learn More About Cardiovascular Disease</h2>
      <p>Even with considerable advances in modern medicine, heart disease remains the biggest killer in the western world today. While cardiovascular disease was once&nbsp;thought of as an affliction of middle-aged, overweight, cigarette-smoking men, we now know today that nearly half of all heart attack deaths occur in women as well.</p>
      <p>In conventional medicine, billions of dollars are spent on highly invasive procedures such as open-heart surgeries and coronary bypass, or balloon angioplasty with stents, but very little attention is placed on the prevention of atherosclerosis (accumulation of plaque in the arteries), which is the underlying cause of the problem.</p>
