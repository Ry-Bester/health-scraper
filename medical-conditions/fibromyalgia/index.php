      <h2>Learn More About Fibromyalgia</h2>    
      <p>Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by poor sleep quality,&nbsp;extreme fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. Patients often experience&nbsp;brain fog, poor concentration and focus, depression, and anxiety. Many may also develop irritable bowel syndrome.</p>
      <p>Conventional physicians may prescribe muscle relaxants, pain medications, and sedative hypnotics such as Ambien. Some may also recommend trigger point injections. Many patients find the above treatments not very effective. They continue to miss work and lose productivity. Quality of life is very poor and relationships are adversely affected.</p>
      <h2>A Functional Approach</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Allergy Elimination Diet: Avoid gluten, dairy, soy, corn, citrus fruits, and food additives. Avoid sugar and refined carbohydrates. Avoid caffeine, and alcohol.</li>
      <li>IV chelation of heavy metals such as mercury and lead. Once the body is cleared of heavy metals almost always fibromyalgia symptoms resolve completely.</li>
      <li>Gut Repair: Intestinal permeability is tested and if positive, proper nutrients and probiotics are utilized to heal the lining of the gut.</li>
      <li>IV Vitamin Therapy: Myersâ€™cocktail and Vitality drips on a weekly basis followed by IV Glutathione. Many patients see resolution of their symptoms within 4-6 weeks.</li>
      <li>Neurotransmitter testing: Balancing the brain neurotransmitters with proper amino acids and enhancing adrenal function which is a powerful tool in overcoming Fibromyalgia.</li>
      <li>Hormonal Optimization: Balancing thyroid hormones, Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone, and DHEA is also very helpful in treatment of Fibromyalgia.</li>
      </ul>
