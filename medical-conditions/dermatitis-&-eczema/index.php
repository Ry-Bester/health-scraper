      <h2>Learn More About Dermatitis &amp; Eczema</h2>
      <p>Eczema or dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition, which is marked by redness, itching, weeping, crusting, and skin pigmentation. Environmental factors such as soaps, detergents, shampoos, dust mites, pets, pollens, mold, bacteria, viruses, and fungi are few of&nbsp;the eczema causes. Heavy metals such as mercury and lead also play a major role in causing inflammation of the skin. Dairy and soy products, eggs, nuts and seeds, and wheat can also cause eczema.</p>
      <p>Emotional stress can make symptoms worse. Hormone imbalance may also affect the skin and worsen eczema. Many patients may suffer&nbsp;from this dermatitis for years and go from doctor to doctor using only topical steroid&nbsp;ointments, salves and antibiotics but never get to the root cause of the condition.</p>
      <p>Most&nbsp;patients with dermatitis suffer from a leaky gut syndrome, have a low count of friendly&nbsp;bacteria in their gut, and may have yeast overgrowth and sensitivity to yeast. Its essential to rule out <a href="/medical-conditions/leaky-gut-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaky gut syndrome</a>, and if present to treat it completely with natural remedies for dermatitis. Antifungals are sometimes used to treat candida and other fungal infections, which may be the underlying cause of dermatitis.</p>
      <h2>IV Chelation Therapy is Very Effective in Treating Chronic Dermatitis.</h2>
      <p>We encourage patients to replace amalgam fillings in a safe manner and go through a series of <a href="/treatments/iv-chelation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV chelation therapy</a> to remove all heavy metals from their system. A high dose <a href="/treatments/vitamin-c-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV vitamin C</a> protocol is also utilized in treating dermatitis. The intestinal function is optimized&nbsp;with supplements for eczema by use of digestive enzymes, probiotics, glutamine, and aloe vera.</p>
      <h2>Holistic Treatment for Eczema:</h2>

      <li>Strengthen your gut by taking probiotic and eradicating yeast and bad bacteria</li>
