      <h1>Hair Loss</h1>><h2>Learn More About Hair Loss</h2>
      <p>One of the main causes of hair loss is stress and adrenal insufficiency. Dr.&nbsp;Lalezar will order a neurotransmitter test which consists of 4 saliva&nbsp;samples throughout the day and the second morning urine collection.&nbsp;Adrenal support supplements and amino acids are recommended to&nbsp;rebuild the adrenal glands. Thyroid may also play a major role in hair&nbsp;loss. When patients have high loads of heavy metals, thyroid hormones&nbsp;donâ€™t convert properly and as a result patients experience subclinical&nbsp;hypothyroid symptoms including hair loss.</p>
      <p>Selenium, Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Iodoral, zinc, rosemary leaf extract is&nbsp;recommended to prevent this poor thyroid hormone conversion. This&nbsp;combination also improves thyroid receptor sensitivity. IV&nbsp;chelation therapy repairs thyroid and adrenal function and halts hair loss.</p>
      <p>Other nutrients such as high dose Biotin, Silica, and Collagen are used in&nbsp;treatment of hair loss.</p>
      <p>A liver cleanse is also recommended to enhance processing of androgenic&nbsp;hormones such as Testosterone and DHEA. Estrogen and Progesterone&nbsp;ratio is also balanced through hormone therapy and detoxification.</p>
      <p>Digestive enzymes, hydrochloric&nbsp;acid, and probiotics are utilized to enhance and optimize absorption of nutrients.</p>
