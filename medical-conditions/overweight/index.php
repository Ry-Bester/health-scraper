      <h1>Overweight</h1><h2>Learn More About Overweight Conditions</h2>
      <p>For many of us, it’s hard to find the time and energy to work in the recommended amount of exercise per day. Sometimes, the most relaxing way to counter a long day at the office is by consuming a filling meal. Ironically, by quenching hunger and then some, you may be on the road to an unhealthy disease. Excess body fat may suddenly accumulate, which is harmful to any lifestyle because your body’s weight affects a multitude of conditions.</p>


      <h2>Obesity Defined</h2>
      <p>Obesity occurs when body fat climbs dangerously high. How high? A BMI (body mass index) of 25-29.9 is considered “overweight”; obesity is defined as a BMI of 30 or more. A person is said to be “morbidly obese” if their BMI exceeds 40.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bmicalculator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.bmicalculator.org/</a></p>
      <h2>Dangers of Obesity</h2>
      <p>Along with a lowered life expectancy, obesity has very negative lifelong effects. Possible conditions brought about by obesity include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Heart disease</li>
        <li>High cholesterol and triglycerides</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
        <li>Arthritis</li>
        <li>Poor bone health</li>
        <li>Cancer</li>
        <li>Sleep disorders</li>
        <li>Infertility</li>
        <li>Depression and mood swings</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Causes of Obesity</h2>
      <p>There are many conditions and behaviors that may lead to obesity, the most obvious being the excessive consumption of calories. But aside from overeating, significant factors associated with obesity include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased age / reduced metabolic rate (BMR)</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and childbirth</li>
        <li>Low physical activity</li>
        <li>Family history of obesity</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome</li>
        <li>Thyroid and adrenal disorders<br>
        Hypothyroidism can cause significant weight gain<br>
        Adrenal stress and excessive cortisol production can cause weight gain</li>
        <li>Other Hormone imbalances</li>
        <li>Medications<br>
        Antidepressants<br>
        High blood pressure medications</li>
        <li>High-glycemic index foods, e.g. refined carbohydrates<br>
        High-fructose corn syrup is notoriously bad</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More often than not, these factors are linked together, making it harder to beat the disease without help.</p>
      <h2>What is metabolic syndrome and why is it important?</h2>
      <p>Metabolic syndrome is a dangerous constellation of symptoms:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Central obesity (fat concentrated around your middle)</li>
        <li>Low HDL (good) cholesterol with elevated triglycerides, a.k.a. dyslipidemia</li>
        <li>High blood glucose (insulin resistance)</li>
        <li>High blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you have metabolic syndrome, you are much more likely to develop type 2 diabetes. This goes hand in hand with blood vessel damage (atherosclerosis), heart disease, kidney disease, stroke, and nerve damage. Many type 2 diabetes sufferers are obese, and people with metabolic syndrome are often considered pre-diabetic.</p>
      <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar does not simply have you stand on a scale, record your weight, and set a target; she investigates to find which root causes of obesity may be applicable to your individual situation. Diagnostic tests include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Complete blood workup with chemistry, hormone and specific thyroid panels</li>
        <li>Micronutrienttesting
      <ul>
        <li>Heavy metal toxicity testing (urine toxicology screening)</li>
        <li>Metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes testing<br>
        Cardiac risk markers (CRP, Homocysteine, and Ferritin)<br>
        Detailed cholesterol and lipid profile (HDL, LDL, lipoproteins)<br>
        Hemoglobin A1C test –measures glycated hemoglobin; indicates type 2 diabetes or a pre-diabetic condition</li>
      </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
