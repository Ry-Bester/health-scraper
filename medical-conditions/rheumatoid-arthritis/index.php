      <h2>Learn More About Rheumatoid Arthritis</h2>
      <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune chronic inflammatory disease of the small joints in your hands and feet which can eventually cause joint deformity. In autoimmune diseases the immune system mistakenly attacks your own body. It can also affect the skin, eyes, lungs, and blood vessels.</p>
      <p>As a Functional Medicine practitioner in Los Angeles, Dr. Lalezar believes autoimmune diseases originate in the gut. When the intestinal lining loses its integrity and becomes permeable, immune complexes comprised of antibodies and antigens leak out of the gut and attack other systems in the body including the joints, skin, thyroid, and many other organs.</p>
      <p>A thorough work up includes a CDSA to evaluate the good and the bad bacteria, digestion, absorption, and inflammation in the gut. A blood test is performed to evaluate intestinal permeability and to rule out leaky gut syndrome. Food allergy and sensitivity test is also performed.</p>
      <p>A liver cleanse and an allergy elimination diet is recommended to clear and enhance detoxification pathways in the liver. Gut reviving supplements such as probiotics, glutagenics, and digestive enzymes are prescribed. MSM powder and IV MSM is also recommended to reduce inflammation in the joints.</p>
      <p>IV chelation therapy is utilized to remove heavy metals which may be the cause&nbsp;of leaky gut syndrome and autoimmunity.</p>
      <p>At times Minocycline antibiotic use has also been very effective in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
