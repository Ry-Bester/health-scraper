      <h1>Digestive Disorders</h1>
      <h2>Learn More About Digestive Disorders</h2>
      <p>The symptoms of most digestive disorders are unfortunately all too familiar for most of us: heartburn, painful stomach cramps, gas, bloating, constipation, and diarrhea. However, a wide variety of causes –often hidden – may be responsible for these symptoms.</p>
      <p>Dr Lalezar states, “Many of my patients suffered from digestive disorders for years without knowing why or doing anything about it. It’s as if they just expected to always have an upset stomach and were resigned to their fate. They finally came to see me because they couldn’t take it anymore.”</p>
      <h2>Accurate diagnosis is the first step in treating any digestive disorder</h2>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar will conduct a series of diagnostic tests to&nbsp;determine the root cause of your particular digestive problem. These tests may include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><a href="/treatments/leaky-gut-and-food-allergy-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food and Environmental Allergy Testing</a></li>
      <li><a href="/treatments/cdsa-comprehensive-digestive-stool-analysis/">Comprehensive Stool Analysis with Parasitology</a> (CDSA&nbsp;or GI Effect by Genova)</li>
      <li>Tests for H.pylori (the cause of ulcers and certain stomach cancers)</li>
      <li><a href="/treatments/urine-toxicology-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Urine Toxicology Screen</a></li>
      <li>SIBO Breath Test to rule out Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Once your condition is determined, Dr Lalezar will then design and develop an individualized, comprehensive treatment plan in order to restore gut health and help you get back to feeling like yourself again –or better!</p>
      <h2><strong>Types of Digestive Disorder We Can Treat</strong></h2>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>IrritableBowelSyndrome (IBS)</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>Caused by muscle spasms in the colon.<strong><br>
      </strong></li>
      <li><strong>C</strong><strong>rohn’s Disease</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>Crohn’s disease is a form of IBD (inflammatory bowel disease), and may result from an abnormal immune response to gut bacteria. Toxins produced by these bacteria can leak through the gut into the bloodstream, resulting in inflammation.<strong><br>
      </strong></li>
      <li><strong>C</strong><strong>eliac Disease</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>Also a type of IBD, celiac disease is associated with an allergy to wheat gluten.<strong><br>
      </strong></li>
      <li><strong>H</strong><strong>eartburn/Gastric Reflux (GERD)</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>This is more than just an occasional annoyance that happens when you eat an everything-on-it pizza or a spicy Indian curry; instead, it is a chronic condition that causes unpleasant symptoms on a daily or near-daily basis.<strong><br>
      </strong></li>
      <li><strong>B</strong><strong>acterial Infections</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>Dysbiosis or imbalance in gut flora can occur after recurrent uses of antibiotics and not be taking the proper probiotic to replace the friendly bacteria that was eradicated along with bad bacteria.<strong><br>
      </strong></li>
      <li><strong>I</strong><strong>ntestinal Parasites</strong></li>
      <li><strong>F</strong><strong>ungal/Yeast Infections (Candida)</strong><strong><br>
      </strong>Candida usually overgrows when there is a high intake of carbohydrates or sugar in the diet. &nbsp;It could also occur as a result of recurrent antibiotic use.</li>
      <li><strong>Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth (SIBO)</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>What are the treatments like to restore gut health?</h2>
      <p>Dr Lalezar combines conventional methods with complementary or alternative therapies. This integrative approach results in a lasting and effective treatment, not only to relieve your symptoms but also to resolve the underlying conditions that caused those symptoms, thereby improving your overall health and well-being.</p>
      <h3>From choosing the best probiotic for IBS or natural remedies for GERD, the treatments can include:</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Customized diet plans/Allergy Elimination Diet</li>
