      <h2>Learn More About Memory Problems</h2>
      <h3>Is the inability to concentrate worrying you? Do you have trouble focusing?</h3>
      <p>At HVC we understand how the inability to focus can be upsetting and we are here to help. Your memory and brain function can be affected by many factors such as hormone imbalance, nutritional deficiencies and heavy metals to name a few.</p>
      <p>Another common culprit of <a href="/medical-conditions/brain-fog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brain fog</a>, poor memory or difficulty concentrating, is thyroid deficiency. We have found that treatments involving thyroid hormone replacements often enhance memory dramatically. <a href="/medical-conditions/heavy-metal-toxicity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heavy metals</a> such as lead and mercury are neurotoxins and effect brain function and memory. In order to eliminate these harmful toxins, we have successfully treated many patients with poor concentration, poor memory or focus with <a href="/treatments/iv-chelation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV Chelation</a>.</p>
      <h3>Patients state that brain fog lifts once the body is cleared of all heavy metals.</h3>
      <p>To enhance memory and focus, nutrients such as different like amino acids, fish oil, blue-green algae, and trace minerals are also recommended supplements for concentration.&nbsp;<a href="/treatments/vitamin-c-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IV Vitamin C</a> and <a href="/treatments/glutathione-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glutathione IV</a> are other utilized treatments to build up serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine&nbsp;in the brain, which are excellent natural remedies for memory loss.</p>
