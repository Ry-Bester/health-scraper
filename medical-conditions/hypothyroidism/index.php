      <h2>Learn More About Hypothyroidism</h2>
      <p>Thyroid hormone plays a major role in regulating different functions in&nbsp;the body and balancing the metabolic rate. When thyroid is&nbsp;malfunctioning many organs in the body will suffer. Often a patient may&nbsp;have all the symptoms of hypothyroidism such as hair loss, brittle nails,&nbsp;constipation, dry skin, poor memory, poor concentration, and cold&nbsp;sensitivity and yet blood tests such as TSH may be completely within&nbsp;normal range. Most likely patientâ€™s basal body temperature is low and&nbsp;reflexes are slow. If a patient presents with subclinical hypothyroidism,&nbsp;Dr. Lalezar will recommend a natural thyroid hormone along with&nbsp;supplements that would enhance thyroid receptor sensitivity. Heavy&nbsp;metal detoxification and adrenal supplements are also very helpful in&nbsp;reversing hypothyroidism. Heavy metals are responsible for conversion&nbsp;of T4 to RT3 which in effect competes with active T3 and causes&nbsp;symptoms of hypothyroidism. Chelation therapy reverses this poor&nbsp;conversion of thyroid hormone and restores optimal thyroid function.</p>
