      <h2>Learn More About Parkinsons Disease</h2>
      <p>A spilled cup of coffee because of slightly shaky hands. Difficulty signing a check at the grocery store. Trouble “getting the words out” when speaking. All of these may be things you chalk up to getting older, but that would be an incorrect assumption. The three scenarios described above are all classic symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, which tends to occur more often in older people, but can certainly affect younger patients as well.</p>
      <h2>Natural Medicine and Parkinson’s</h2>
      <p>If you have Parkinson’s disease, you may be scared and confused about what to do next. You might wonder if natural medicine could help. Dr. Shiva Lalezar, a highly regarded holistic doctor in Los Angeles and the medical director of the Health &amp; Vitality Center, has helped many patients with various stages of Parkinson’s disease mitigate their symptoms, regain their self-confidence, and live more normal lives.</p>
      <h2>Causes of Parkinson’s</h2>
      <p>Research shows the root cause of Parkinson’s symptoms is the death of a specific type of brain cell. There are two important issues to consider:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Death of dopamine-producing neurons in part of the brain called the substantianigra results in Parkinson’s disease</li>
      <li>Glutathione deficiency:&nbsp; Low levels of glutathione leave brain cells damaged by oxidation</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Parkinson’s treatment options</h2>
      <p><strong><em>Conventional approach<br>
      </em></strong>Conventional treatments for Parkinson’s disease have made a huge difference in patients’ lives. From the discovery of the breakthrough drug L-dopa to the more sophisticated class of medications known as dopamine agonists (Requip, Mirapex), Parkinson’s treatment has evolved significantly over the past 60 years. However, a number of patients cannot tolerate the newer drugs because of severe side effects and overtime symptoms of Parkinson’s worsen and higher doses of medications are necessary.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Functional medicine/integrative approach<br>
      </em></strong>Glutathione is an antioxidant that binds to dangerous toxins and facilitates their easy elimination. Healthy glutathione levels are severely decreased by about 40-50% in Parkinson’s patients, which leaves brain cells extremely vulnerable to oxidation. Intravenous glutathione, which effectively treats neurodegenerative disorders—including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s—has been scientifically proven to alleviate disabilities brought on by Parkinson’s disease. Dr. Lalezar has achieved excellent results in using glutathione IV to treat her Parkinson’s patients.</p>
      <h2>How glutathione gets you moving</h2>
      <p>Over twenty years of research support a link between the death of dopamine-producing neurons and glutathione deficiency. Here’s what the research says about glutathione:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Glutathione limits free radical production</li>
        <li>Glutathione is a strong reducing agent, protecting brain cells against oxidative damage</li>
        <li>Glutathione slows the effects of Parkinson’s while improving brain function</li>
        <li>Without enough glutathione, brain cells are more easily damaged by oxidation and destroyed, and improvement is essentially impossible</li>
        <li>Using infusion therapy, glutathione is a leading symptom reducer of Parkinson’s.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar has seen an 80-90% improvement rate among her Parkinson’s patients who have undergone IV glutathione therapy.</p>
