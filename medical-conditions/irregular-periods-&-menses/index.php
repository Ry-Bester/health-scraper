      <h1>Learn About PMS Treatment</h1><h2>Premenstrual tension affects about 3 out of 4 menstruating women.</h2>
      <p>For many, PMS symptoms vary between mood swings, irritability, breast tenderness, food cravings, fatigue, and depression. Premenstrual symptoms may also include physical symptoms such as menstrual cramps, &nbsp;joint pain, bloating, water retention, headache, acne, and constipation.</p>
      <p>Usually, the symptoms occur 1-3 weeks prior to menses and resolve at the onset of the menstrual cycle. For some the emotional and physical symptoms of PMS are severe enough to affect their daily lives. Here at HVC, we have developed methods that offer PMS relief.</p>
      <p>One of the fastest PMS treatment we offer is a <a href="/treatments/myers-cocktail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Myer’s Cocktail</a>. Patients who have received Myers’ cocktails for 5 consecutive weeks have reported relief of mood swings, food cravings, and menstrual cramps. Headaches resolve and fatigue subsides</p>
      <p>Another PMS relief is natural progesterone therapy, a powerful way to treat PMS symptoms. The dosage is tailored to the individual’s need and it’s prescribed for 1-3 weeks prior to menses to be applied at night time. This therapy balances the estrogen-progesterone ratio.</p>
      <p>A <a href="/treatments/liver-cleanse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liver cleanse</a> is also recommended to improve the processing of hormones and toxins. Phase I and Phase II detoxification pathways make toxins and hormone by-products water soluble, and it enhances their excretion from the body. Patients who have done the 10-day liver cleanse experience 70% improvement in their PMS symptoms.</p>
