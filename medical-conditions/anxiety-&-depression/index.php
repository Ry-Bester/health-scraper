    <h2>Learn more about Anxiety and Depression Treatment – Los Angeles</h2>
      <p>A certain amount of anxiety is normal. It’s a coping mechanism for dealing with everyday stress. Let’s say you have ten minutes to get to work but you’re stuck in gridlocked Los Angeles traffic 30 miles from your office. At the same time, your spouse calls your cell phone and starts arguing with you. To top it off, you hear a siren and see flashing lights – a cop is pulling you over.</p>
      <p>Such a situation would be a natural and expected cause of anxiety.</p>
      <h2>When does anxiety become a medical problem?</h2>
      <p>For some of us, anxiety is a constant, a looming presence in our lives; we worry so much about everything that we can’t go about our day-to-day activities and live a normal life.</p>
      <p>That’s when it becomes a medical problem and is considered to be an anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is one type of anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks. A panic attack is a sudden onset of intense fear; symptoms may include a racing heart, sweating, hyperventilation, nausea and stomach upset.</p>


      <h2>Think you might be suffering from depression?</h2>
      <p>The Health &amp; Vitality Center can help you see the light. We’re amongst the best treatment centers for depression and anxiety in Southern California.</p>
      <p>More than one in 3 Americans are diagnosed with depression and one in 10 Americans are prescribed antidepressants. Unfortunately, medications may mask symptoms temporarily but cannot cure depression because the root cause of the illness has not been determined.</p>
      <p>Also, these causes may be different in different individuals and yet the conventional treatment is the same for every person.</p>
      <h3>How to treat depression and anxiety naturally with a&nbsp;Functional Medicine approach.</h3>
      <p>Many patients come to me having tried different psychiatric medications without success. We start by testing patient’s Genomics, gut function, food allergies, heavy metals, nutritional deficiency, and hormone levels.</p>
      <p>Often times just healing the gut, removing triggers such as gluten from the diet, and chelating heavy metals heals the broken brain and depression and anxiety lifts. Patients start having more energy and their focus and memory improves. This change in their physiology lifts the symptoms of despair, hopelessness, and sadness.</p>
      <p>We offer holistic treatment for depression, an approach that goes directly to the root cause of the problem.</p>
      <h2>Xanax isn’t always the answer!</h2>
      <p>Mind-numbing and addictive medications such as Xanax and Valium are widely prescribed by most conventional doctors to treat the symptoms of anxiety and panic attacks. At the Health and Vitality Center, the wellness clinic founded by Los Angeles holistic doctor Shiva Lalezar, we know that medications may temporarily alleviate symptoms, but they don’t provide any guarantee that the problem won’t reoccur.</p>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar’s practice looks beyond treating the symptoms, focusing on identifying and treating the underlying causes of your anxiety and/or depression.</p>

      <h2>Which diagnostic for anxiety/depression stress test does Dr. Lalezar use?</h2>
      <p>Dr. Lalezar looks at the important, contributing mechanisms that trigger anxiety and depression? These include hormone levels, heavy metals, chemical imbalances in the brain, and inadequate nutrition.</p>

      <li>Urine Toxicology Screening</li>
      <li>Hormone Panel (including Thyroid Panel)</li>
      <li>Genomind</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What might underlying medical conditions be associated or causative factors?</p>  
      
      <ul>
      <li>Hormonal imbalance</li>
