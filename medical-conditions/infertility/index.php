      <h1>Infertility</h1><h2>Learn More About Infertility</h2>
      <p>Infertility may be caused by different factors. There may be hormone&nbsp;imbalance, adrenal dysfunction, thyroid dysfunction, heavy metal burden,&nbsp;or nutritional deficiency. There may also be a structural defect which affects the release of an egg into the fallopian tube or the uterus. Also&nbsp;the environment of the cervix may not be suitable to receive a sperm.&nbsp;Many men are also having poor quality and quantity of sperm due to&nbsp;environmental toxins.</p> 

      <p>A Functional approach in treatment of infertility is to enhance the gut&nbsp;function and optimize absorption of nutrients. All hormones including&nbsp;Cortisol, Thyroid, Estrogen, Progesterone, Testosterone and DHEA are&nbsp;balanced. A liver cleanse is recommended to enhance processing of all&nbsp;hormones. IV Chelation is recommended to clear all heavy metals. IV&nbsp;vitamin drips such as high dose vitamin C, Myers’ cocktail, and IV&nbsp;Glutathione is recommended to build up nutritional status and enhance&nbsp;antioxidant levels.</p>
      <p>This type of a work up is useful for men or women who are intending to&nbsp;conceive. It’s a wonderful way to prepare the body to optimize the&nbsp;chances of a successful pregnancy and delivery of a healthy baby clear of&nbsp;environmental toxins. The highest rate of transmission of Mercury is&nbsp;through the placenta into the fetus. Could this be the cause of rise in&nbsp;Autism in the United States?</p>
